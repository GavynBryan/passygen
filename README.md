# passygen
A semantic password generator for troubled minds. Flying on React.js wings

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works?

The generator selects 2 or more words from 2 lists: adjectives and nouns, and builds a password that makes sense when you read it. The format always will be "(prefix) + adjective(s) + separator(s) + noun + (suffix)"

Example: `%co0L;Hors3%`
